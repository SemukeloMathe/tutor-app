# Tutor App

Tutor App is a full-stack platform that connects students with qualified tutors.
Students can browse, request, and book lessons while tutors can manage their availability, respond to requests, and receive payments â€” all in one seamless experience.

The application is designed with scalability and reliability in mind, using a service-oriented architecture with FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, and Docker.
