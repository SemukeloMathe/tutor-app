# Tutor App

Tutor App is a full-stack platform that connects students with qualified tutors.
Students can browse, request, and book lessons while tutors can manage their availability, respond to requests, and receive payments — all in one seamless experience.

The application is designed with scalability and reliability in mind, using a service-oriented architecture with FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, and Docker.

## ✨ Features (Planned)

- Secure Sign Up & Login – Role-based authentication for students and tutors.

- Lesson Requests & Scheduling – Students request lessons, tutors accept or reject.
- Payments Integration – Seamless and secure in-app payments.
- Ratings & Reviews – Students provide feedback after lessons.
- Real-time Video Lessons – Built-in video sessions between students and tutors.
